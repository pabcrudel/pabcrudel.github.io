        SpaceApps Valencia <time datetime="2023">2023</time>
      </h2>

      <p>
        I participated with my classmates in the NASA SpaceApp Hackathon in
        Valencia. We were there because Jorge Lopez, our teacher, encouraged us
        to participate not only to face the challenge and gain experience but
        also to improve our self-confidence.
      </p>

      <p>
        The Hackathon started on <time datetime="2023-10-06T19:00">Friday,
        October 6th, at 7:00 PM</time> at
        <a href="https://wayco.es/coworking-en-valencia/cabanyal/"
          title="Coworking Space in Valencia">Wayco Cabanyal</a>
        After the presentations, we began our challenge:
      </p>

      <blockquote id="hackathon-challenge" cite="https://www.spaceappschallenge.org/2023/find-a-team/juandeteam/?tab=project">
        <h3>Managing Fire: Increasing Community-based Fire Management
        Opportunities</h3>
        <p>
          NASA's satellite-derived active fire data are freely available and
          provide valuable information to a wide range of users. However, as
          wildfires continue to increase in frequency, number, and size, the
          need for more diverse stakeholder groups to understand and use these
          data is rapidly expanding. Your challenge is to develop solutions to
          address fire and natural resource monitoring through innovative use of
          technology and publicly available data, enabling local communities to
          report and monitor fires and/or improve current data distribution.
        </p>
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        We worked hard until <time datetime="2023-10-08T17:00">Sunday at 5:00
        PM</time> when we showed our projects. Facing the challenge over the
        weekend was a big test for us, and we learned a lot about working as a
        real team using Git and developing an <abbr title="Application">App
        </abbr> from scratch using vanilla <abbr title="JavaScript">JS</abbr>,
        <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> and <abbr
        title="Cascade Style Sheet">CSS</abbr>.
      </p>

      <p>
        After all the hard work and collaboration, we were thrilled to present
        our real app during the event. Despite not using the latest technologies
        or groundbreaking approaches, our app, deployed on GitHub Pages,
        successfully addressed the challenge with a minimal viable product.

        Winning the event was a fantastic surprise, and it showed us that even
        simple solutions can make a meaningful impact. This experience has
        fueled our enthusiasm to keep learning and contributing to innovative
        projects in the future.

        <h3>Fostering Growth: The Purpose Behind the Fork</h3>

        <p>
          Since the project's inception, my consistent commitment has been
          instrumental in refining features, addressing functionalities, and
          introducing enhancements to elevate the user experience.
        </p>

        <p>
          To transparently showcase and document these contributions, I've
          created a personal fork of the main repository. This fork serves as a
          dedicated space to highlight my work, providing a platform for
          effective code management.
        </p>

        <p>
          It's important to note that, in maintaining the project's integrity,
          all enhancements are proposed through pull requests (PRs) to the main
          repository. While currently the primary contributor, my focus is on
          upholding code consistency and quality.
